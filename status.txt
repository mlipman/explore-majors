status.txt

trying to use a rake task to input data fro testData.txt into models in my app
then inspect those simple to see it worked
need to split and test to know when to make a req and when to make an option and when to save and what parent req and option to use etc

goal from testData
Rec: core1, parent is symsys option
option: blad, parent is core1rec
req



UPDATE CALTRAIN

got hte rake file working for well formatted class lists
next step is to add in auto OR processing - done

Next:
Add a partial for req and/or a partial for opt that can be displayed as needed easily
Also, make data pages for more majors. Engineering next

EE notes
I think I need a more complicated model
Ideally, it would have:
68 unit minimum accross multiple reqs
check for WIM, design course
check that fuundamental 3 is not in cs/ee
support elective list
add notes 

Doing now: adding user and course models so you can have users that have courses.

added login
next allow logged in users to edit the classes they've taken and plan to take
maybe have two sets of have many courses, taken and planned
