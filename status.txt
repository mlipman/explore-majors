status.txt

trying to use a rake task to input data fro testData.txt into models in my app
then inspect those simple to see it worked
need to split and test to know when to make a req and when to make an option and when to save and what parent req and option to use etc

goal from testData
Rec: core1, parent is symsys option
option: blad, parent is core1rec
req



UPDATE CALTRAIN

got hte rake file working for well formatted class lists
next step is to add in auto OR processing - done

Next:
Add a partial for req and/or a partial for opt that can be displayed as needed easily
Also, make data pages for more majors. Engineering next

EE notes
I think I need a more complicated model
Ideally, it would have:
68 unit minimum accross multiple reqs
check for WIM, design course
check that fuundamental 3 is not in cs/ee
support elective list
add notes 

Doing now: adding user and course models so you can have users that have courses.
