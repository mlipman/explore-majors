status.txt

trying to use a rake task to input data fro testData.txt into models in my app
then inspect those simple to see it worked
need to split and test to know when to make a req and when to make an option and when to save and what parent req and option to use etc

goal from testData
Rec: core1, parent is symsys option
option: blad, parent is core1rec
req



UPDATE CALTRAIN

got hte rake file working for well formatted class lists
next step is to add in auto OR processing - done

Next:
Add a partial for req and/or a partial for opt that can be displayed as needed easily
Also, make data pages for more majors. Engineering next

EE notes
I think I need a more complicated model
Ideally, it would have:
68 unit minimum accross multiple reqs
check for WIM, design course
check that fuundamental 3 is not in cs/ee
support elective list
add notes 

Doing now: adding user and course models so you can have users that have courses.

added login
next allow logged in users to edit the classes they've taken and plan to take
maybe have two sets of have many courses, taken and planned


Current: in lair. things working, but not pretty. next: try to add atuo req completion detection on branch detect

On greyound:
Goal is to allow users that are logged in to easily add courses
On probably courses/new, search to bring up classes, thne have a portion on the right hand side of the button that has a plus or minus on it



// ADD DROPPING CLASSES AND REAL TIME ALERT/COLOR UPDATES AFTER ACTIONS
// ALSO LOOK INTO REPEATS IN THE USERS' CLASS LIST

users can now add and drop classes from search page by hitting + or -
classes change color to indicate status - but callback functions not working
also ms&e doesnt work
and live search sometimes returns nothing, like math
8/30 closed manage_classes
open connect_explore
goals:
add back login accross whole site, with hashed passwords - done
add color scheme to explore page - red if not taken, green if taken, cream if logged out - done
make expore formatting better




coloring in explore is awesome, 
next add add/drop button to explore - not sure what to do with reqs
maybe have js use +- in reqs to expand it out
clean up css

8/31 close connect_explore

unresolved issues:
next add add/drop button to explore - not sure what to do with reqs
maybe have js use +- in reqs to expand it out
clean up css
also, see bugs

9/4 open require
big picture:
new requirement structure that includes unit mins, reqs hav reqs (chunks), sets
actual classes
improved rake task
end vision for this step: top dozen majors with real classes
timeline: by first class (9/23)


9/8
Added files and migration for chunks
Next step: add in db objects (manually first, probabaly, then with rake) to test.
Maybe look into direct db access a la mysql michael1.
Test:
O Electrical_Engineering
	Ch Math_Science
		Ch Math
			R SV_Calc
				O 40s
					C Math41
					C Math42
				end
			end
			R MV_Calc
				OC Math51
				OC CME100
			end
		end
		R Science
			OC Sci100
		end
	end
	R TIS
		OC TIS100
	end
	R ET
		OC ENGR100
	end
end


9/28
to reset db
rake db:migrate:reset
rake readcourses
rake dochunks (takes about 3 minutes)


todo - ALL Done
sets - done
line color done
chunk fulfilled done
pick your major done

add chunks to option display, in getORCTable and when checking class.name
